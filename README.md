## About 

This repository provides code for computing most likely trajectories describing rare events that correspond to the emergence of non-dominant genotypes. The codes are based on a large deviations approach for discrete Markov chains describing the genetic evolution of large bacterial populations. We implement two algorithms, one based on a greedy search and the other one based on a gradient descent type algorithm. You can find additional information regarding our approach in the publication referenced below.
